# mulmoterminal

A browser-based terminal for running [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
sessions, with a sidebar that lists the current project's chat sessions and shows
live, hook-driven activity for each one.

Each session runs as a real PTY on the server (`claude` in a pseudo-terminal) and
is streamed to an [xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org/) terminal in the browser over a
WebSocket. A sidebar lists every Claude session for the project and reflects, in
real time, which sessions are **working** (Claude is thinking) and which **need
attention** (waiting for input, or finished with output you haven't seen).

**Inserting a file path** — like a native terminal, you can put a file's absolute
path into the prompt: **drag a file** onto the terminal (works where the browser
exposes the path via `file://` — Firefox/Safari), or click the **📎 file button**
in the terminal header, which asks the local server to open the OS file dialog and
inserts the chosen path (works in every browser, including Chrome). The path is
inserted at the cursor — it is not submitted, so you can review it first.

---

## Install & run

Requires the [`claude`](https://claude.com/claude-code) CLI on your `PATH` and
**Node ≥ 22.9**.

```bash
npx mulmoterminal           # start on http://localhost:3456 and open the browser
# or install globally:
npm install -g mulmoterminal
mulmoterminal
```

A global install isn't auto-updated, so on startup MulmoTerminal checks npm and
prints a one-line notice when a newer version is available (`npm i -g mulmoterminal`
to update). Disable with `MULMOTERMINAL_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` (or `NO_UPDATE_NOTIFIER=1`).

Options: `--cwd <dir>` (working directory — relative paths allowed; defaults to the
directory you run the command from), `--port <n>` (default 3456), `--no-open`,
`--version`, `--help`.

```bash
npx mulmoterminal --cwd ./my-project   # work in a specific directory
```

The published package ships the server (run via `tsx`) plus the pre-built web UI;
`npx mulmoterminal` checks for the `claude` CLI, picks a free port, starts the
server, and opens the browser. For local development from a clone, see
[Running](#running).

```

- **Terminal I/O** flows over a raw WebSocket (`/ws`), one PTY per session.
- **Session list** is fetched over HTTP (`/api/sessions`).
- **Live activity** is pushed over a Socket.IO pub/sub channel (`/ws/pubsub`);
  the server learns of activity from **Claude hooks** that POST to `/api/hook`.
- The Vite dev server proxies `/ws`, `/ws/pubsub`, and `/api` to the backend;
  in production the backend serves the built client from `dist/`.

---

## Why a PTY?

Claude Code's interactive mode renders its UI with [Ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink)
(a React-based TUI framework), which requires a real **TTY** to be attached. A
plain `child_process.spawn()` provides no TTY, so interactive Claude won't start
(it stays silent). [node-pty](https://github.com/microsoft/node-pty) allocates a
real **pseudo-terminal** at the OS level, so from Claude's point of view it's
running in an ordinary terminal — full TUI rendering, cursor movement, colors,
and tool-approval prompts all work. We don't use `-p`/headless mode or the Agent
SDK; we drive the real interactive CLI and relay its TTY over the WebSocket.

> **macOS note:** node-pty's bundled `spawn-helper` binary ships without the
> execute bit (mode 644), which causes a `posix_spawnp failed` error. The
> `postinstall` script (`server/fix-pty-perms.js`) fixes it to 755 automatically.

## Tech stack

| Layer    | Technology |
| -------- | ---------- |
| Frontend | Vue 3 (`<script setup>` + TypeScript), Vite, xterm.js (`@xterm/*`), socket.io-client |
| Backend  | Node (ESM, TypeScript run via `tsx`), Express 5, `ws` (terminal WebSocket), `node-pty`, socket.io |
| Tests    | Vitest + @vue/test-utils + jsdom |

Requires **Node ≥ 22.9** (uses `node --env-file-if-exists`) and the `claude` CLI on `PATH`.

---

## Configuration

The server is configured entirely through environment variables, optionally
loaded from a `.env` file via `node --env-file-if-exists=.env` (wired into the
npm scripts). The `.env` is optional — every variable below has a default, so
the server runs without one.

| Variable     | Default        | Description |
| ------------ | -------------- | ----------- |
| `PORT`       | `3456`         | HTTP/WebSocket port. |
| `CLAUDE_BIN` | `claude`       | The Claude Code binary to spawn. |
| `CLAUDE_CWD` | current dir    | Working directory each `claude` PTY runs in; determines which project's sessions the sidebar lists. Via `npx mulmoterminal` it defaults to the directory you ran the command from (override with `--cwd <dir>`, relative allowed); when the server is run directly it falls back to `~/mulmoclaude`. A value read from `.env` must be an absolute path (`~` is not expanded). |

Example `.env` (gitignored):

```
CLAUDE_CWD=/Users/you/my-project
```

---

## Running

```bash
yarn install            # postinstall fixes node-pty prebuilt binary perms

yarn dev                # server (:3456) + Vite dev server, concurrently
# or individually:
yarn dev:server         # backend only  (node --import tsx --env-file-if-exists=.env server/index.ts)
yarn dev:client         # Vite dev server only

yarn build              # type-check (vue-tsc) + vite build -> dist/
yarn typecheck:server   # type-check the server (tsconfig.server.json)
yarn server             # run backend; serves dist/ + the APIs on :3456
yarn test               # vitest run
```

The backend is TypeScript run directly via `tsx` (no build step); `server/` is
type-checked separately through `tsconfig.server.json` (`strict`), kept out of
the main `build` so the two type-check independently.

In dev, open the Vite URL; its proxy forwards `/ws`, `/ws/pubsub`, and `/api` to
`:3456`. In production, run `yarn build` then `yarn server` and open
`http://localhost:3456`.

---

## Server API specification

Base URL: `http://localhost:$PORT` (default `http://localhost:3456`).

### HTTP: `GET /api/sessions`

Lists the most-recent chat sessions for the current project (`CLAUDE_CWD`),
newest first, including freshly-created sessions that aren't yet written to disk.

**Response `200 application/json`**

```jsonc
{
  "cwd": "/Users/you/my-project",
  "sessions": [
    {
      "id": "d16f43f3-ef63-4a5e-b273-debaccb3522a", // session UUID (= .jsonl basename)
      "title": "Review available skills list",        // see "Session discovery & titles"
      "mtime": 1781471064511.22,                       // last-modified, ms epoch (sort key)
      "working": false,                                // Claude is mid-turn (blue dot)
      "waiting": false                                 // needs attention (bold)
    }
    // ...
  ]
}
```

- Sessions are read from `~/.claude/projects/<encoded CLAUDE_CWD>/*.jsonl` and
  merged with in-memory sessions started this run but not yet persisted (those
  have `title: "New session"` and `mtime` = creation time).
- Sorted by `mtime` descending and capped at the **50** most recent. Files are
  ranked by a cheap `stat`-only pass; only the top 50 are read and parsed for
  titles, so the endpoint stays cheap regardless of how many sessions exist.
- `500 { "error": string }` on an unexpected filesystem error. A missing project
  directory is **not** an error — it yields an empty `sessions` array.

### HTTP: `POST /api/hook`

**Internal endpoint.** Claude hooks (injected per session — see
[Claude hook injection](#claude-hook-injection)) POST their event payload here.
You normally don't call this yourself.

**Request `application/json`** — the Claude hook payload; only these fields are used:

```jsonc
{
  "session_id": "d16f43f3-...",        // the session the event is for
  "hook_event_name": "UserPromptSubmit" // "UserPromptSubmit" | "Stop" | "Notification"
}
```

Effect (see [Session model](#session-model)):

| `hook_event_name`  | Effect |
| ------------------ | ------ |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | `working = true` for the session. |
| `Stop`             | `working = false`; if the session is **backgrounded**, also `waiting = true`. |
| `Notification`     | If the session is **backgrounded**, `waiting = true`. |

Any resulting state change is published on the `sessions` pub/sub channel.

**Response `200 application/json`**: `{ "ok": true }` (always, even for unknown events).

### WebSocket: `/ws` (terminal)

A raw WebSocket carrying the terminal stream for one session. One PTY per
connection (or reattach to an existing background PTY).

**Connect**

- `ws://host/ws` — start a **new** session (server generates a UUID and spawns
  `claude --session-id <uuid> --settings <hooks>`).
- `ws://host/ws?session=<id>` — **resume/reattach** a session. If a live
  background PTY exists for `<id>`, the socket reattaches to it (and its recent
  output buffer is replayed); otherwise the server spawns
  `claude --resume <id> --settings <hooks>`.

**Server → client** (JSON text frames):

| Message | Meaning |
| ------- | ------- |
| `{ "type": "session", "id": string }` | Sent immediately on connect — the session id this socket is bound to (lets the client learn a new session's generated id). |
| `{ "type": "output", "data": string }` | PTY output to write to the terminal. On reattach, the first `output` frame is the replayed tail buffer (≤ 64 KB). |
| `{ "type": "exit", "exitCode": number, "signal": number }` | The `claude` process exited; the socket then closes. |

**Client → server** (JSON text frames):

| Message | Meaning |
| ------- | ------- |
| `{ "type": "input", "data": string }` | Keystrokes / bytes to write to the PTY. |
| `{ "type": "resize", "cols": number, "rows": number }` | Resize the PTY. |

A non-JSON frame is written to the PTY verbatim (fallback).

**Disconnect** — when the socket closes, if Claude is still `working` the PTY is
**kept alive** in the background; otherwise it's killed. See
[Session lifecycle](#session-lifecycle).

### Socket.IO: `/ws/pubsub` (activity pub/sub)

A minimal Socket.IO pub/sub for live session-activity updates. Channel names are
Socket.IO rooms.

- **Path**: `/ws/pubsub`, transport: `websocket`.
- **Client → server events**:
  - `subscribe` with a channel name (string) → join the room.
  - `unsubscribe` with a channel name (string) → leave the room.
- **Server → client event**: `data` with `{ channel: string, data: <payload> }`.

**Channel `"sessions"`** — payloads describe a single session change:

```jsonc
// activity change (working/waiting flipped)
{ "id": "d16f43f3-...", "working": false, "waiting": true, "event": "Stop" }

// a brand-new session was created
{ "id": "…", "working": false, "event": "created" }

// a session's PTY was closed/reaped
{ "id": "…", "working": false, "event": "closed" }
```

`event` is the originating hook (`UserPromptSubmit` | `Stop` | `Notification`) or
a lifecycle marker (`created` | `closed` | `null`). The client treats **any**
`sessions` message as a signal to refetch `GET /api/sessions` (the server is the
single source of truth for the list), so payload details are advisory.

---

## Session model

Per-session state lives on the server (`activity` map) and is surfaced as two
booleans on every session record:

| Flag      | Set when | Cleared when | UI |
| --------- | -------- | ------------ | -- |
| `working` | `UserPromptSubmit` hook fires (Claude started a turn) | `Stop` hook fires (turn finished) | **Blue dot** next to the title |
| `waiting` | A **background** session fires `Notification` (waiting for input — permission / question / idle) **or** `Stop` (finished, output unseen, ready for another message) | The session is brought to the **foreground** (a WebSocket attaches to it) | **Bold** title |

"Foreground" = a session that currently has an attached terminal WebSocket (the
one you're viewing). `waiting` is only ever set for **background** sessions,
because a foreground session is already on screen.

---

## Session lifecycle

```
        new ws /ws                         ws /ws?session=<id>
            │                                      │
            ▼                                      ▼
   generate UUID, spawn               live bg PTY?  ──yes──►  reattach + replay buffer
   claude --session-id <uuid>              │ no
   register "New session",                 ▼
   publish "created"               spawn claude --resume <id>
            │                                      │
            └───────────────┬──────────────────────┘
                            ▼
                   attached (foreground)  ── setWaiting(false) ──► not bold
                            │
              ws close (switch away / disconnect)
                            │
            ┌───────── working? ──────────┐
           yes                            no
            │                             │
   keep PTY alive (background)        kill PTY (reap), publish "closed"
            │
   Stop hook in background:
   waiting=true (bold), working=false, reap PTY
   (flag persists via on-disk record → stays listed & bold until viewed)
```

Key rules:

- **Switching away never interrupts Claude mid-turn** — a `working` session's PTY
  survives in the background.
- A background session that goes **idle** (`Stop`) is **reaped** (killed). If it
  finished with unseen output, its `waiting` flag persists via the on-disk
  session record, so it stays listed and **bold** until you open it.
- **Reattach over respawn**: selecting a session that still has a live background
  PTY reattaches to it (replaying a ≤ 64 KB output tail) instead of spawning a
  duplicate `claude`.
- Brand-new sessions appear in the sidebar **immediately** (before their `.jsonl`
  exists) via the in-memory `knownSessions` registry + a `created` push; an
  unused one disappears when its PTY is reaped.

---

## Claude hook injection

Activity is detected via Claude Code hooks injected **per spawn**, without
touching the user's `~/.claude/settings.json` or project settings. The server
passes `claude --settings '<json>'` where the JSON registers a command hook for
`UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`, and `Notification`, each of which pipes the hook
payload to the server:

```jsonc
{
  "hooks": {
    "UserPromptSubmit": [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "curl -s -X POST http://localhost:$PORT/api/hook -H 'content-type: application/json' -d @-" }] }],
    "Stop":             [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "curl … -d @-" }] }],
    "Notification":     [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "curl … -d @-" }] }]
  }
}
```

Because the server spawns each new session with `--session-id <uuid>`, it always
knows the live session's id — even before the session's `.jsonl` file exists.

---

## Session discovery & titles

Claude stores each project's sessions as JSONL files under
`~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<session-id>.jsonl`, where the absolute `cwd`
has its `/` and `.` characters replaced with `-` (e.g.
`/Users/you/proj` → `-Users-you-proj`).

A session's display **title** is derived by scanning its JSONL for, in order of
preference:

1. the latest `ai-title` record's `aiTitle`,
2. else the latest `last-prompt` record's `lastPrompt`,
3. else the first real user message (slash/local-command wrappers like
   `<local-command-…>` are skipped),
4. else `"(untitled session)"`.

In-memory sessions not yet persisted show as `"New session"` until their file
appears, at which point the on-disk title takes over.

---

## Testing

```bash
yarn test
```

`src/components/Sidebar.spec.ts` covers the sidebar: rendering the server's
session list, the working dot, the `waiting` bold state, refetching on a pub/sub
push, and emitting `select` on click. The pub/sub composable and `fetch` are
mocked so the tests run without a server.
